## UI Kata

This is part of my UI Kata learning initiative. I find sketch files of UI's on the internet and code them up focusing on 4 things:
 - React component structure
 - pixel perfect CSS
 - responsiveness (mobile first)
 - component testing

## Design Credits

TBA


## TODO

- write tests
- abstract out reusable components from gallery and tips
- handle media query for the InlineForm component
